2. Use apt-offline
You can use apt-offline to prepare a list of packages that need to be installed so that you can install the software you want, then transfer that list to a machine with internet access, download the needed packages, transfer these back to your offline VM, then install them there.

install apt-offline: go to https://packages.ubuntu.com and download the .deb file of apt-of:fline for your architecture (it has no special dependencies, so you only need that)
use scp to copy the deb file onto your offline server
sudo dpkg -i apt-offline*something.deb on the server
generate a request for a package index update and consequent installation of a package on the offline machine: sudo apt-offline set --install-packages PACKAGENAME --update apt-offline.sig 
copy the that apt-offline.sig file to your online machine
on the online machine, execute that request: apt-offline get --bundle bundle.zip apt-offline.sig 
copy the bundle.zip to your offline machine
on the offline machine, sudo apt-offline install bundle.zip and
finally, you can install the package on your offline machine: sudo apt install PACKAGENAME.
