this file contains hints for the massively unintuitive PoS
associated with MacOS and maybe IOS. 
###################

the *default* setting for the Mac's filesystem is case insensitive.
This is bizarre and horrible. It can have terrible consequences for 
build systems and "duplicate" file names (though people who use capital 
letters in file names are for the most part philistines as well)

If you didn't know this and have already used your system, it is possible 
to stake a claim to part of the unused storage space and reformat and redefine
it to be case sensitive.

to do this:

- add an APFS volume
- Disk Utility app, select an existing APFS volume and click Add Volume
- the options are variation on plain, encrypted, case sensitive
- choose wisely and set the other options like mount point

###################

To protect the snowflake users of Macs from potentially dangerous files on 
their systems, the default security settings for some applications prevents
access to those files. For example, the terminal application does not initially 
get access to some ~/Library files. To fix this:
 
- pull down System Preferences from the Apple icon (top left on most screens)
- choose Security & Privacy
- select Privacy tab
- click on the Full Disk Access icon
- find the terminal (or other app) and check the box; this may require 
  clicking the lock (lower left) to unlock the applications

###################

another annoying default setting is the number of file descriptors, which is set to 256
this causes mayhem when trying to build applications under AOSP (*not* the whole thing, just 
a single application like strace)
ulimit -a  # shows all defaults
ulimit -n  # shows open file limit
ulimit -n 4096  # works; linux seems to use 1024 so that may be good enough

# note this is per shell, not global
