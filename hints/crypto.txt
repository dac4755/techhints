# convert to a pem format
openssl pkcs7 -inform DER -print_certs -out cert.pem -in CERT.RSA

# print cert info:
keytool -printcert -file CERT.RSA

# once you have the cert.pem file you can get the public key by using the following command:
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -text

# If you only want to get the part of public-key out of the CERT.RSA file, you can try out the following method:

# convert CERT.RSA to a standard pem file:
openssl pkcs7 -in CERT.RSA -inform DER -print_certs -out cert.pem

# get public key from the pem file:
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -pubkey -noout

# to compare public keys to see if they share a prime, use SageMath. see
# keyresolver.py in this repo. Any keys that output two numbers where one is not
# '1' then you have a common factor.

# inspect a certificate

openssl x509 -in file.crt -noout -text | keytool -printcert

# look at certificates for a web site:
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect google.com:443

# generate a key file and a csr
openssl genkey > file.key
openssl req -new -sha256 -key file.key -out file.csr
